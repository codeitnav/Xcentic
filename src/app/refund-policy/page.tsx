              At Xcentic Technologies, we are committed to delivering high-quality digital services including software
              development, digital marketing, branding, and legal solutions. Due to the nature of our work, all sales
              and service agreements are final, and we maintain a strict no-refund policy.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. No Refunds on Services</h2>
            <p>
              Once a service has been purchased, initiated, or delivered (in whole or in part), we do not offer refunds
              under any circumstances, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Change of mind</li>
              <li>Delay in client response</li>
              <li>Business decisions</li>
              <li>Project discontinuation by the client</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Custom and Digital Work</h2>
            <p>
              Most of our services involve custom work, digital deliverables, and strategic efforts tailored
              specifically to each client&apos;s requirements. These are non-tangible and non-returnable, making them
              non-refundable once the project has begun or the scope has been agreed upon.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Advance Payments and Retainers</h2>
            <p>
              All advance payments, milestone payments, or retainers made toward any project or engagement are
              non-refundable. These payments reserve resources and time, and are allocated immediately upon
              confirmation.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
              4. Exceptions (Only If Mentioned in a Written Contract)
            </h2>
            <p>
              In rare and exceptional cases where a partial refund is explicitly stated in a written agreement (signed
              by both parties), such refunds will be processed according to the terms mentioned in that contract.
            </p>
            <p>If no such clause exists in writing, this no-refund policy prevails.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>You may request project cancellation at any stage; however:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Any work completed up to that point will be billed</li>
              <li>No refunds will be provided for payments already made</li>
              <li>
                All associated files and rights will remain the property of Xcentic Technologies unless otherwise agreed
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Disputes</h2>
            <p>
              If you believe there has been an error or issue in service delivery, please contact us within 7 days of
              project milestone delivery. We&apos;ll do our best to resolve concerns amicably, but this does not entitle you
              to a refund unless stated in writing.
            </p>
